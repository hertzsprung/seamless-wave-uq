\section{Idealised numerical tests}

Three numerical tests are performed to validate the well-balanced stochastic Galerkin model.
The first test simulates a lake-at-rest over idealised, uncertain topography to verify that the stochastic Galerkin model preserves well-balancing numerically.
The second test simulates flow over a hump with an uncertain elevation.
This test is designed to challenge the stochastic Galerkin model at representing discontinuous, non-Gaussian probability distributions by generating a steady-state solution that may be subcritical or transcritical depending on the hump elevation.
The third test verifies the robustness of the stochastic Galerkin model for a steady flow over a highly irregular and uncertain bed that is more representative of real-world river hydraulics.
\rev{The configuration of these three tests is summarised in table~\ref{tab:results}.}

\subsection{Specification of Tests 1 and 2}
For the first two tests, the 1D domain is [\SI{-50}{\meter}, \SI{50}{\meter}], tessellated by $M = 100$ elements with no overlaps or gaps such that the mesh spacing is $\Delta x = \SI{1}{\meter}$.
The timestep is $\Delta t = \SI{0.15}{\second}$ resulting in a maximum Courant number of about $0.8$.
By choosing a fixed timestep, simulations of a given test complete in the same number of timesteps irrespective of the model configuration, and error accumulation due to timestepping errors will be the same across all models.

Both tests include a topographic hump centred at $x = \SI{0}{\meter}$ with a region of Gaussian uncertainty.
Following a similar approach to \citet{ge2008}, there are two representations for the same uncertain topography.
The first representation enables smooth topography profiles to be randomly generated in Monte Carlo iterations.
The topography $z$ is defined as
\begin{align}
z(x, \hump) = \hump \sech^2 \left( \frac{\pi x}{\lambda} \right) \label{eqn:bed}
\end{align}
where the hump amplitude $\hump$ is a random variable with mean $\humpmean = \SI{0.6}{\meter}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_\hump = \SI{0.3}{\meter}$, and the half-width is $\lambda = \SI{10}{\meter}$.
This topography profile is seen in figure~\ref{fig:criticalSteadyState-flow}.
The second representation is used by the stochastic Galerkin model, with topography represented by expansion coefficients $z_{i,0}, \ldots, z_{i,P}$.
To be able to calculate the topography expansion coefficients, equation~\eqref{eqn:bed} must be expressed in terms of mean topography $\zmean(x)$ and topographic variance $\sigma_z^2(x)$ without involving the random variable $\hump$.
The mean topography $\zmean(x)$ is simply
\begin{align}
    \zmean(x) = z(x, \humpmean)
    \label{eqn:bed-mean}
\end{align}
The topographic variance is
\begin{align}
    \sigma^2_z(x) = \E[z^2(x, \hump)] - \E^2[z(x, \hump)]
    \label{eqn:bed-variance}
\end{align}
Equation~\eqref{eqn:bed-variance} can be rewritten using Taylor series expansions of the two terms $\E\left[z^2(x, \hump)\right]$ and $\E^2\left[z(x, \hump)\right]$.
To illustrate the approach, a Taylor series expansion of $\E\left[ z(x, \hump) \right]$ about $\humpmean$ is 
\begin{align}
    \E\left[ z(x, \hump) \right] &= \E\left[ z(x, \humpmean + (\hump - \humpmean)) \right] \nonumber \\
    &= \E\left[ z + \frac{\partial z}{\partial \hump} (\hump - \humpmean) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial \hump^2} \left(\hump - \humpmean\right)^2 + \mathcal{O}(\hump^3) \right]
    \label{eqn:mean-taylor}
%
\intertext{where $z$ is shorthand for $z(x, \humpmean)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\hump^3)$ is the error term involving high-order derivatives $\partial^m z/\partial \hump^m$ with $m \geq 3$.
Since $\E\left[ \hump - \humpmean \right] = 0$ and $\E\left[ \left(\hump-\humpmean\right)^2\right] = \sigma_\hump^2$ then equation~\eqref{eqn:mean-taylor} simplifies to}
%
    \E\left[ z(x, \hump) \right] &= z + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial \hump^2} \sigma_\hump^2 + \mathcal{O}(\hump^3)
\end{align}
Applying this approach to equation~\eqref{eqn:bed-variance} gives:
\begin{align}
    \sigma_z^2(x) &=
    z^2 +
    \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \hump}\right)^2
    + z \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial \hump^2}
    \right]
    \sigma^2_\hump
    -
    \left[
    z + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial \hump^2} \sigma_\hump^2
    \right]^2 + \mathcal{O}(\hump^3) \label{eqn:z-taylor}
%
\intertext{For the topographic profile given by equation~\eqref{eqn:bed}, it holds that $\partial^m z/\partial \hump^m = 0$ where $m \geq 2$, so the Taylor series approximation introduces no spurious oscillations in stochastic space.
The topographic variance in equation~\eqref{eqn:z-taylor} then simplifies to}
%
    \sigma_z^2(x) &= \left( \frac{\partial z(x, \humpmean)}{\partial \hump} \sigma_\hump \right)^2 \label{eqn:z-variance-continuous}
\end{align}
Equipped with analytic expressions for the mean topography $\zmean(x)$ (equation~\ref{eqn:bed-mean}) and topographic variance $\sigma_z^2(x)$ (equation~\ref{eqn:z-variance-continuous}), now the topography expansion coefficients $z_{i,0}, \ldots, z_{i,P}$ can be calculated.
Since the topographic bump has a Gaussian probability distribution with $\mu_1[z(x)] = \zmean(x)$, $\mu_2[z(x)] = \sigma_z^2(x)$ and high-order moments $\mu_m[z(x)] = 0$ for $m \geq 3$ then, using equations~\eqref{eqn:moment}, \eqref{eqn:mean} and \eqref{eqn:variance}, the topography expansion coefficients are
\begin{align}
    z_{i,p} = \begin{cases}
    \zmean(x_i) & \text{if $p=0$} \\
    \sigma_z(x_i) & \text{if $p=1$} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eqn:z-pc-coeffs}
\end{align}
where values are calculated at the centre point $x_i$ for all elements $i=1,\ldots, M$.

%and $z_{i,1}$ is calculated using equations~\eqref{eqn:z-variance-continuous} and \eqref{eqn:variance} with $\mu_2[z(x, \xi)] = \sigma_z^2(x)$.

The initial water depth expansion coefficients $h_{i,0}^{(0)}, \ldots, h_{i,P}^{(0)}$ can be calculated in terms of free-surface elevation and topography using equation~\eqref{eqn:h-eta-z}.
For both tests, the initial, spatially-uniform mean free-surface elevation is \SI{1.5}{\meter} with no initial uncertainty such that $\eta_{i,0}^{(0)} = \SI{1.5}{\meter}$ and $\eta_{i,p}^{(0)} = 0$ with $p = 1, \ldots, P$ and $i = 1, \ldots, M$.
