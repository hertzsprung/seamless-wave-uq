\section{Conclusions and outlook}

This paper proposed a stochastic Galerkin shallow flow model using the surface gradient method to ensure well-balancing.
The well-balancedness of the stochastic model was studied theoretically, and the model was validated using two numerical experiments, both using an idealised topography profile with Gaussian uncertainty.
The first test verified that a lake-at-rest over an uncertain bed was preserved to machine precision.
The second test challenged the stochastic Galerkin model using steady-state critical flow over an uncertain bed.
The test was designed to provoke strongly nonlinear behaviour such that about 50\% of flows were subcritical and the other 50\% develop a transcritical shock.
The resulting probability distributions were discontinuous and highly non-Gaussian.
Without parallelisation, the stochastic Galerkin model was about 100 times faster than a Monte Carlo simulation.
With parallelisation on commodity hardware, the computation time for the stochastic Galerkin model would be on par with a single iteration of the deterministic solver.
Despite its relatively low-order Wiener-Hermite basis, stochastic Galerkin results compared favourably against the Monte Carlo reference solution.

It is likely that a more sophisticated treatment using a multiresolution wavelet decomposition \citep{lemaitre2004a,pettersson2014} or multi-element discretisation of the stochastic dimension \citep{wan-karniadakis2006,li-stinis2015} would further improve the representation of highly non-Gaussian and discontinuous probability distributions.
It is also likely that a decomposition or discretisation of stochastic space would simplify a stochastic reformulation of positivity preserving schemes involving nonlinear operators, so enabling the development of stochastic wetting-and-drying processes.
Such improvements are the subject of future work.
